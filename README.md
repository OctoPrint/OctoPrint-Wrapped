# OctoPrint-Wrapped 🎁

Get your yearly OctoPrint stats a shareable "wrapped" picture - and let it snow! ❄️

The stats picture depends on the Achievements plugin being enabled (as it takes care of
the stats collection during the year). The snow effect can always be toggled during
the season and its setting persists through the browser's local storage.

Both wrapped and snowfall are only available from December 1st until January 10th.

or manually using this URL:
